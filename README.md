# Employee Attendance System using AI/ML and CCTV

This repository contains the project for the IdeaNthon hackathon, which is an Employee Attendance System using AI/ML and CCTV. The project aims to automate the process of taking attendance in an organization by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques combined with CCTV footage.

## Features

- Automatically detect and recognize employees from CCTV footage.
- Utilize machine learning algorithms to verify employee identities.
- Capture timestamps for employee entry and exit.
- Generate accurate attendance reports.
